                In order to prevent and discourage fraud and unauthorized transfers of monetary funds, c1k service has introduced client bank card verification required for carrying out financial exchange operations. The verification process is carried out as soon as possible.

        <h4>Why is bank card verification necessary?</h4>
        <div class="table-info-person-text">

            <p>
                Verifying bank cards serves to confirm that the c1k exchange service client is indeed the owner of the card and is carrying out the transaction voluntarily. This procedure makes it harder for fraudsters to carry out transactions without the consent of the card owner. The verification process only takes a few minutes and is done only once for each new bank card that is added. Clients of the c1k exchange service that have undergone the verification procedure will be able to carry out transactions using accounts and cards registered with various banking institutions. Using other payment systems and electronic wallets is allowed by default, with no verification required. Clients are not permitted to use IP masking software (proxy servers, VPN’s, etc.).
                <p/>
                <p>To verify a bank card on the c1k exchange service, follow these steps:</p>

                    <li>The photo needs to be taken with the c1k.world website as the background.</li>
                    <li>If the bank card has your name on it, then the first and last 4 digits of the card number should be visible, as well as the owner’s name and surname. All other details can be covered up.</li>
