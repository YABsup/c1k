    Dear users! After registering with one of our services (c1k.world and c1k-fin.world), you will have a single account on both. If your Client has registered and placed orders on one resource, and then decided to place orders on the other one, he/she can use the same login and password for authorization. Such transactions will also be credited to you. The same applies to referral links. <br>
    If any questions arise, contact our company representative at <a href="https://t.me/PR_C1K"><span style="color:red">Telegram</span></a>

As part of this affiliate program, the following restrictions have been implemented:
    <ol>
    <li>
    You should not promote your advertising channels about the same project or with the same public figure.
    </li>
    <li>
    All channels participating in this program should correspond to different projects. If you have a personal project, you should have two affiliate accounts. You can use your personal account to act as a manager.

The service administration reserves the right to request marketing material from you (e.g. links to videos) at any time in order to confirm the correct number of active advertising channels.
